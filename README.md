# From Me to You: Peer-to-Peer Collaboration Infrastructure with Linked Data Annotations

Implementation of a peer-to-peer (P2P) system that leverages collaboration, local-first principles, and more on [W3C Web Annotations](https://www.w3.org/TR/annotation-model/). The system provides software for local nodes that store annotation, was well as an API for integrating clients over native sockets as well as WebSockets.

More on that: https://kassel.works/thesis

**Important**: This is alpha software for research. Your annotations will be available publicly and accessible without authentication.

## Terminology

- **Swarm**: As annotations (and all other data of this system) are basically decentralized, we can't just connect to a server given its IP address. Hence, we connect to a decentralized routing table ([Hyperswarm](https://github.com/hyperswarm/hyperswarm), a [Kademlia DHT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kademlia)) and join swarms on particular topics, where participants are expected to provide topic-related information.
- **CRDT**: A Conflict-Free Replicated Datatype (CRDT) is a data structure that is expected to have no merge conflicts when applying changes from different sources (think a heavenly Git) under the assumption of Eventual Consistency ([Shapiro et al., 2011](https://hal.inria.fr/hal-00932836/file/CRDTs_SSS-2011.pdf)). Thus, we can collaboratively work on a distributed document without an authoritarian server that handles merging.
- **Peer** and **Client**: P2P networks generally consist of equal peers which request and serve information alike. However, the [Web Annotation protocol](https://www.w3.org/TR/annotation-protocol/) bears a reliance on HTTP. As opposed to [stream-based replication](https://github.com/mafintosh/hyperdb/issues/153) of distributed data, annotations are provided on a per-request basis. We decided to distinguish between **a)** ‘Peers’ that replicate natively and provide data via HTTP to swarms and **b)** ‘Clients’ that request data from within swarms.

## Architecture

This is a work-in-progress and more elaborate documentation will follow. A buzzword-y summary could be: Annotations are organized in notebooks, one notebook per resource (a `target` in Web Annotation speak). These notebooks are stored in a JSON-based CRDT, [Hypermerge](https://github.com/automerge/hypermerge). The replication of these CRDTs to other peers happens via [Hyperswarm](https://github.com/hyperswarm/hyperswarm), a Kademlia DHT.

Discovery of related work on a particular resource also happens via Hyperswarm, as peers join the respective swarms and announce themselves as connection targets. To be _somewhat_ consistent with the [Web Annotation Protocol specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/annotation-protocol/), a bridge network is then created for distribution of documents to _clients_ (think a browser-based application). Communication over this bridge networks happens via Hyperswarm, too, but with a HTTP-ish protocol, as Hypermerge [doesn't (and likely won't) support the web platform](https://github.com/automerge/hypermerge/issues/3). Browsers join the bridge network [via WebSocket gateways](https://github.com/falafeljan/hyperswarm-ws).

## Usage

Start the local replication peer via `npm start [-v]`. Will (for now, for testing purposes) create a new repository and new document if none exist. They are stored on the local disk, with data stored in `.data` and repository information stored in `repos.json`. Provide `-v` to run a volatile, in-memory node for testing things out quickly and temporarily.

Execute all commands with `DEBUG=me2u*` to receive debug information.

### Development Scripts

- `node scripts/announcement-test.js <target> <doc-url>` Test the distribution announcement functionality. Will join peer nodes in pretending to provide a particular document for a particular JSON-LD target.
- `node scripts/add-notebook.js <target> [<title>]` Will add a new notebook for the given target and title to the repository.
- `node scripts/bridge-test.js <doc-url>` Will attempt to load a document and related docs via the bridge network from a running peer.
- `node scripts/console.js <doc-url>` Open a development console that connects to the distribution swarm of a given document. Execute arbitrary requests of the HTTP-ish protocol: `<method> <path>` (e.g., `get /annotations.jsonld`).
